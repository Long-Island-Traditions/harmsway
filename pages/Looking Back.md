#Looking Back

Hurricanes, tropical storms, and other significant weather events have cast a long shadow of devastation across our region's history. The "Great September Gale" of 1815 was the worst hurricane to strike Long Island in the early 19th century. The "Long Island Express" slammed into this area on September, 21, 1937, with the eye passing over Westhampton Beach. Local groups, individuals, and government agencies responded by planting grass on beaches and building groins and jetties to stabilize the beach and to prevent erosion. They set up emergency communication systems and the Red Cross providd shelter to local residents. These approaches continue to the present, in order to prevent the kind of devastation that occurred that fateful day. 

After World War II people moved to Long Island's coastal communities, living in vacation or permanent homes built on former marshalnds or barrier beaches that flooded regularly. For many the storms felt unique, not to be replicated. But as the years went by, more storms came to Long Island. By 1968 hurricanes and other severe storms wer so common that Congress established the National Flood Insurance Program to help homeowners rebuild.
