# Bay House Resilience
Bay houses are small shacks that stand on the South Shore's fragile marshlands. These small houses were originally built in the 1700 and 1800s by fishermen, baymen, and duck hunters. These bay dwellers used the shelters while they harvested clams and salt hay, or went duck hunting. Through the years, these historic stuctures have been passed down among families. 

During the 1940s through the 1960s more residents built bay houses as weekend getaways. By 1965 there were over 200 bay houses. In 1965 the Town of Hempstead removed most of the bay houses in an effort to preserve the sensitive wetlands on which they stand. 

However, a result of research and advocation by Nancy Solomon, director of Long Island Traditions, the Town made the decision to preserve the fragile structures for future generations. Most of the houses that stand today range from 30 to 100 years old. 

The bay houses generally face South, to take advantage of the sunlight and the cool North-South breezes. They stand on "mud sills" consisting of long poles that lay on the marshland with upright posts to support the platform which in turn supports the house. Unlike traditional houses, there is no permanent foundation on a bay house. Many differnt kinds of materials were used for building these houses, which could take anywhere from a day to a whole year to complete! Because the houses are accessible only by boat, would-be owners often enlist help from friends, family, and co-workers in transporting building materials from the mainland to the marshlands. 

 As mentioned in the Sandy, Irene, and Lee section, 14 bay houses miraculously survived the storm. In this section, we will take a closer look at bayhouses, their custodians, and some of the ingenious storm mitigation strategies used to protect these treasured historic structures.
