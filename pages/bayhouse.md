# Bay Houses in the Storm

Bay houses are small shacks that stand on the South Shore's fragile marshlands. These small houses were originally built in the 16th and 17th centuries by fishermen, baymen, and duck hunters. These bay dwellers used the shelters while they harvested clams and salt hay, or went duck hunting. Through the years, these historic stuctures have been passed down among families. 

During the 1940s through the 1960s more residents built bay houses as weekend getaways. By 1965 there were over 200 bay houses. However, in 1965 the Town of Hempstead removed most of the bay houses in an effort to preserve the sensitive wetlands on which they stand. 

Despite this iniative, as a result of research and advocation by Nancy Solomon, director of Long Island Traditions, the Town made the decision to preserve the fragile structures for future generations. Most of the houses that stand today range from 30 to 100 years old. 

While bay houses have always been in harm's way, increased risk of destruction from natural disasters adds to their precarious existence. Still, "in working and living on the bay, [bay house] owners reaffirm their commitment to the martime traditions of the south shore and to the maintenance of the bay houses." By working in tandem with their environment and with the traditions of thsoe that came before them, bay houses and their stewards remain a precious part of Long Island.

As mentioned in the Sandy, Irene, and Lee section, 14 bay houses miraculously survived the storm. In this section, we will take a closer look at bay houses, their custodians, and some of the ingenious storm mitigation strategies used to protect these treasured historic structures. As part of the In Harm's Way Exhibit, museum staff created a bay house interactive model for visitors to explore.

Bay houses and the environemnts in which they exist share a symbiotic relationship. One ingenious way that bay house owners harness available resources to protect their raised homes from erosion and water damages is to pile bags of clamshells along their pole foundations.

 Bay house windows can be covered to protect the structure in the face of high winds and storms.

 Hatches within the bay house floor help relieve water pressure during floods and protect the structural integrity of the home. Listen to Joseph Pignataro, an architect and resident of Freeport, Long Island, describe the way hatches work in the audio clip below.

  Here is an example of a helical pile,referenced by Joseph Pignataro in his narrative above, which are used to stabilize structures that are in danger of environmental degradation.

Check out these four bay house models created by former bay house owner, Jeff Blossom. Bay houses generally face South to take advantage of the sunlight and the cool North-South breezes. They stand on "mud sills" consisting of long poles that lay on the marshland with upright posts to support the platform which in turn supports the house. Unlike traditional houses, there is no permanent foundation on a bay house. Many differnt kinds of materials were used for building these houses, which could take anywhere from a day to a whole year to complete! Because the houses are accessible only by boat, would-be owners often enlist help from friends, family, and co-workers in transporting building materials from the mainland to the marshlands.
