# Looking Back

>The severe storms of the sixties and the seventies snapped us to attention. Because there was no dune everyone had a good look at the ocean. We started building dunes, installing snow fencing and planting beach grass...Hurricane Gloria showed up and completely wiped out the west end of Long Beach. Their TV's and furniture were floating down Ohio Avenue. The City Manger's phone line lit up and people asked for the dune. We had it done in a month and a half." Tom Doheny, Town of Hempstead, Commissioner of Conservation and Waterways

Hurricanes, tropical storms, and other significant weather events have cast a long shadow of devastation across our region's history. The ["Great September Gale" of 1815](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1815_New_England_hurricane) was the worst hurricane to strike Long Island in the early 19th century. The ["Long Island Express"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1938_New_England_hurricane) slammed into this area on September, 21, 1937, with the eye passing over Westhampton Beach. Local groups, individuals, and government agencies responded by planting grass on beaches and building groins and jetties to stabilize the beach and to prevent erosion. They set up emergency communication systems and the Red Cross provided shelter to local residents. Many of these approaches continue to the present in order to prevent the kind of devastation that occurred that fateful day. 

After World War II people moved to Long Island's coastal communities, living in vacation or permanent homes built on former marshlands or barrier beaches that flooded regularly. For many, the storms felt unique, not to be replicated. But as the years went by more storms came to Long Island. By 1968, hurricanes and other severe storms were so common that Congress established the [National Flood Insurance Program](https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance) to help homeowners rebuild.
