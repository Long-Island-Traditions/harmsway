## About the Collection

*In Harm's Way* was a physical exhibit held from October 6 to December 31, 2017 at the Long Island Museum of Art History and Carriages located in Stony Brook, New York. Aimed at educating, documenting, and sharing the lived experience of natural disasters on Long Island across the last century, *In Harm's Way* showcased stark realities for the community as they coped with the destruction and upheaval created by superstorms like Hurricane Sandy. Although made more prevalent as climate change roars forward, residents of Long Island have a long history of finding creative ways to cope with environmental threats to their habitat. 

This digital exhibit is meant to showcase the materials from the physical exhibit in an online environment so that visitors can experience *In Harm's Way* no matter their location. The exhibit is divided into three sections: Looking Backwards; Irene Lee, and Sandy; and Looking Forwards. Browse through archival photos, video interviews, photos from the 2017 exhibit, and documents from the storms to learn more about Long Island, its history with natural disastors, and the human response to climate change across time.
