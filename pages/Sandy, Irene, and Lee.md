# Sandy, Irene, and Lee

>"The last few years before the storm we caught plenty of fish. After the storm it was a living nightmare. Besides the waters being closed for clamming, you couldn't even drive through town; there were boats in the road everywhere. It was devastation everywhere." -Joey Scavone, Commercial Fisherman, Freeport 

The years 2011-12 will figure prominently as the era when climate change hit home. During Hurricanes Irene and Lee in 2011, upstate residents in Schoharie County found themselves flooded out of their homes, and cut off from neighboring villages and town as rivers overflowed and roads and bridges collapsed. Houses floated away, farms went underwater, and communications collapsed. The same storm struck Long Island with fewer consequences, leading residents to beleive the warnings were inflated. 

In 2012, Superstorm Sandy devastated the region. The six foot storm surge was accompanied by 29 foot waves. As Tood Kaminsky recalled "My grandmother had moved to long Beach in 1949 and never had water. The morning after Sandy, Grandma's house had four feet of water, and the water went from the ocean, crossed Lido Boulevard, went through my parent's house in Lido Beach, and out to Reynold's Channel." Whole communities a mile away from the ocean and bay were struck by the storm surge. Like generations before them, first responders and volunteer groups rescued stranded families, providing shleter and nourishment to all in need. 

Miraculously, 14 bay houses survived, as did modest bungalows in Far Rockaway. Some houses remained dry, while others are uninhabitable five years later, within the same block. Boats that stayed in the water were left intact, while others floated fown the street. In this section we explore what worked and why, based on traditional knowledge and public policy.
